# machine-learning-sperm-dde-exposure
Machine learning algorithms (i.e. random forest and support vector machine) in R are used to identity and visualize the most important differentially methylated region (DMR) predictors in sperm data contain varying levels of the environmental pollutant dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) in order to study the impact of DDE exposure on autism.
